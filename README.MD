# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This project is part of the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" challenge, aimed at developing a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between tweets related to actual disasters and those that are not. This challenge is essential for enhancing disaster management efforts through social media analytics.

## Objectives

- To preprocess and analyze disaster-related tweet data.
- To implement and evaluate various NLP techniques for tweet classification.
- To develop a model that accurately distinguishes between disaster and non-disaster tweets.

## Sections

1. Introduction and Project Overview
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model Building and Evaluation
5. Conclusion and Future Work

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from a Kaggle competition. It consists of tweets that have been labeled as 'disaster' or 'non-disaster'. Detailed information about the dataset and preprocessing steps can be found in the respective sections of the notebook.

## Requirements

This project uses the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Transformers (for BERT model implementation)

Please ensure these are installed before running the notebook. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow transformers
```

## Usage

To run this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Week_4_Natural_Language_Processing_with_Disaster_Tweets.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions and code cells in the notebook to replicate the analysis and model building processes.
